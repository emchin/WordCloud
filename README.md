# WordCloud
My project takes a Messenger chat transcript and turns it into a word cloud!

After downloading my Facebook history, I could download a conversation as a JSON file. From there, I scraped the messages, removed stopwords, sorted the words based off of frequency in the chat, and added customization options: you can choose the color and shape of each wordcloud. 

My final product was a word cloud that served as a snapshot of your chat history with the people in it.
